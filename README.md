## Main Concepts

#### Client APP

A Client App is the classical Angular App, which will be bootstrapped and rendered in the browser. When we create with the CLI a `ng new myAwesomeApp` the result is a client app. 
* The user experience by first load is penalyzed because the user donÂ´t see relevant content until app is bootstrapped.
* The Google Bot (responsibile for crawling pages and ) will index the pages and process teh relevant structure data without problems as is able to wait the boostrapp phase. 
* Other search Bots (bing, ask,..etc) wonÂ´t be able to index the content as their result when visit the page is a empty `<app-root></app-root>` 
* Social Sharing of content Twitter, Fcebook, etc.. will be disable too.

In Summary, if discovery by search boots, 

#### Server Side Rendered APP

The Server Side Render process happen  in a server environment (not in a browser) and return for each route the representtion of the page as a html string. What we call then a Server Side Rendered App is an App which for each requested route have two parts.
1.  A html representation of page server rendered `<app-root> <h1> I am a rendered APP</h1>....</app-root>` 
2.  The client App as described above which after bootstrap will take control and behave like a normal client app.






## Installation

First download and install the schematics package:
`npm i @ampgular/schematics` will install the reuired Files

Seecond generate the files with the angular cli: 
`ng g  @ampgular/schematics:ssr` will install the reuired Files
or 
`schematics @ampgular/schematics:ssr`


## Usage

In the future this package will be shift with a small cli for the ease of use, for now the utilization will be done through some npm run commands predefined and options, a brief summary od the commands

### What can you do then...

1.  You can *build* your app, the server and client bundles [build](#build)
       The options for the build will be picked from angular.json
       and only using one command
       `npm run ssr:build`

2.  You can *serve* your server side app as you would normally ng serve, now here behind the scenes
       we are building on --watch mode, webpacking and serving with the command    `npm run ssr:serve

3.  You can automatizally route scraping your own app to create a routes file with `npm run ssr:spider`

4.  You can with the command  with `npm run ssr:seo` SEO-ing your app whether you have a server side sendered `--server` or a client `--client`

5.  You can make your app deploy ready with one command `npm run ssr:deploy` 

## Building a Server Side Rendered App

The command  `npm run ssr:build` will launch two parallell builds , the normal client side build `ng build` with the same options as
